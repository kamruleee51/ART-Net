# Surgical-Tool-Segmentation
In this project, we present single input multiple output deep convolution neural network (SIMO-DCNN) to get concurrent output which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. We have added two types of skip connection in traditional encoder-decoder network to get precise segmentation and geometric features since exact 3D pose of the surgical instruments depends on geometric features in our approach.

The idea for the single input multiple output (SIMO) DCNN along with transfer learning is shown in the Figure below.
